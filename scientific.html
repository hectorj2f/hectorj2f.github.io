Once I started my Master of Web Engineering, I realized I loved to research about
how to improve the technology, read and write articles, and to build prototypes. As a consequence,
I decided to move towards a scientific career looking to find in the investigation
my final destination.

<br />
<br />
Since 2008, I collaborated with the MDE-OOTLAB research group in the University
of Oviedo in which finished my master thesis as well as wrote several articles
for journals and conferences. In the context of this group, I focused on Software
Engineering areas such as Model Driven Engineering and Business Process Modelling.
However, thanks to the experience obtained during my Master and my daily routine
at the industry, a wish raised on me -- ¨To work abroad as researcher¨. As a
result, I board on my trip and ... Since 2009 to 2012, I did my PhD as a member
of <em><strong><a href="http://www.irisa.fr/myriads">MYRIADS</a></strong></em>
research team in <em><strong><a href="http://www.inria.fr/">INRIA</a></strong></em>
(National Institute for Research in Computer Science and Control). In Myriads,
I focused on service oriented computing on Grids or Clouds infrastructures.
In particular, I was working on decentralized workflow execution using a rule-based
programming models to solve the existing drawbacks on service coordination systems.
<br />
<br />
From August 2012 till October 2013, I worked as a postdoc in the
<em><a href="conpaas.eu"><strong>ConPaaS</strong></a></em> research
  team at the <strong><a href="www.vu.nl" title="VU">Vrije
  Universiteit Amsterdam</a></strong>. This team was enclosed into the
  distributed systems group of the mentioned university. During this
  year, I was working on elastic resource provisioning systems in
  distributed and heterogeneous infrastructures. As a result, I designed
  and succesfully implemented a novel autoscaling system for web
  applications in heteregoneous Clouds.
<br />
<br />
As a continuation of my Dutch experience at <strong><a href="www.vu.nl" title="VU">Vrije
  Universiteit Amsterdam</a></strong>, I joined a great research
  group called <em><strong><a
  href="http://www.s2group.cs.vu.nl">Sofware and Services
  (S2)</a></strong></em> in which I am currently doing my second
  postdoc. A part from my teaching duties, my research topics of
  interest are focused on energy-aware systems and software in large
  infrastructures. Finally, I managed to combine two of my main concerns
  environmental friendly approaches and software design.
