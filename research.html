								<h3>Teams</h3>
<ul>
<li>
  <strong><a href="https://sites.google.com/site/mdeootlab/"
  title="MDE-OOTLAB">Oviedo3-OOTLab</a> </strong> (2008-01-02 –
  ongoing) is a group of investigation about model driven software and
  business process in the University of Oviedo, (Spain). </li>
					<li>	<strong> <a href="http://www.irisa.fr/myriads/" title="MYRIADS">Myriads </a> </strong> (2009-06 – 2012-07) is a research team that designs and implements systems and environments for autonomous service and resource management in distributed  virtualized infrastructures. The team tackles the challenges of dependable application execution and efficient resource management in the future Internet of Services. INRIA, (France).</li>

					<li>		<strong> <a href="http://www.conpaas.eu/" title="ConPaaS Team"> ConPaaS </a>  </strong> (2012-08 - 2013-10) is a research team enclosed in the distributed systems group
								at the
								Vrije
								Universiteit
								Amsterdam. This
								team
								aims
								to
								provide
								an
								open-source
								PaaS
								that
								solves
								most
								of the
								existing
								challenges
								when
								deploying
								applications
								(services)
								in the
								Cloud. Thus
								ConPaas
								offers
								an
								easy
								way to
								add,
								deploy
								and
								release
								Cloud
								nodes
								on
								which
								these
								services
								run. You
								do not
								need
								to get
								new
								Cloud
								nodes
								by
								hand,
								and
								load
								the
								services
								on
								each
								of
								them. Nowadays,
								ConPaaS
								supports
								the
								following
								services:
								PhP-based,
								MySQL,
								Task
								Farming,
								Map-Reduce,
								Scalarix,
								Selenium
								and
								Java. </li>

								and Services
								</a>
								</strong>
								(2013-09
								- ongoing)
								Our
								research
								focuses on social and sustainable models and design in software and services engineering. Topics such as social service models, sustainability in software engineering, green IT strategies, SOA migration and modernization, are well within our research playground. By exploring social aspects of services, we are struggling to understand and support “socio-technical congruence” within software-intensive software systems. Exploring sustainability aspects of services, we are struggling to understand and support the business level of complex systems, to verify and sustain their economic endurance.

								<h3>Projects</h3>
<ul>
							<li>
  <strong> S-Cube </strong>(2008-03 -- 2012-03) -- S-Cube, the
  European Network of Excellence in Software Services and Systems,
  will establish an integrated, multidisciplinary, vibrant research
  community. This will enable Europe to lead the software-services
  revolution, thereby helping shape the software-service based
  Internet which is the backbone of our future interactive society
  (see the S-Cube homepage). S-Cube is a 4-year EU-sponsored research
  project, with the goal of integrating european research effords in
  the area of service-based systems. </li>

<li>
<strong>AutoChem </strong>(2008-02 – 2011-12) This project aims at investigating and exploring an unconventional approach, based on chemical computing, to program complex computing infrastructures, such as Grids and real-time deeply-embedded systems. Chemical computing uses the chemical reaction metaphor to express the coordination of computations.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Contrail </strong>(2012-08 - 2013-10) The goal of the Contrail Project is to design, implement, evaluate and promote an open source system for Cloud Federations. Contrail will leverage and extend the results from the XtreemOS FP6 IP project, which builds a Linux-based operating system to support Virtual Organizations for next-generation Grids.
</li>
<li>
<strong>MRE Cluster Green Software </strong>(2013-09 - on-going) MRA Cluster Green Software is a R&D project on green software. Within this project research and validation will take place, in collaboration with the knowledge institutes and industry partners within the project team. The aim is to group knowledge and research results on the green software subject and force a breakthrough on innovation and sustainability. Within this project we will develop a new research infrastructure, tools and models and validate them in practice. This might results in new R&D projects, involvement of small and medium sized enterprises and possible spin-offs. Finally this project should contribute to the development of this specific green IT industry in the Amsterdam region.
